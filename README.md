# weather_witness

A simple weather app created using [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) services. The project application can show the current weaher data such as temperature, weather condition, pressure and many more. The application could also display the forecast data of the weather condition. The project used plain Javascript, CSS, HTML as well as PHP for API data fetching. 

Since I deployed this application to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) (website link: https://weather-witness.herokuapp.com), I used heroku's "Config Vars" to store the API key rather then storing it in text files. You could setup your own environment configuration variables locally using [phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)

## Things to work on:
 - Refactoring code
 - Better styling
 - Dark mode support
 - Using graph to represent data
